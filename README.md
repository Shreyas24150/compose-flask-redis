**ðŸš€ Flask + Redis App with Docker Compose**

This repository provides a minimal Flask application that tracks how many times a specific route is requested. The app uses Redis to persist the count and is deployed inside a fully containerized environment with Docker Compose.

Flask â€“ A lightweight web framework for Python
Redis â€“ A fast in-memory key-value store (acts as the counter)
Docker â€“ The standard for containerizing applications
Docker Compose â€“ A tool for managing multi-container setups
